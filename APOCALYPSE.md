# The Apocalypse 

## Apocalypse

The apocalypse happens 13 rounds after it has been triggered. A player may still win during these turns. 

To count the rounds of the apocalypse, the player who triggered it takes a tzompantli and fills it with 12 skulls.Each round after the apocalypse has been triggered, when the player with the tzompantli's turn comes up, they remove one skull to count down the number of rounds until the end of the game. 

The apocalypse may be forestalled if the sacrifices to the two Templo Mayor gods are exactly even. While the apocalypse is forestalled, no skulls are removed from the tzompantli counter. The countdown resumes when the number of skulls is uneven in favor of either God. The game ends when the countdown reaches zero. 

Once it has been triggered, the apocalypse will always happen in one of two ways: a flood, or a war, depending on which god has been given the least sacrifices. 

## Tlaloc's Flood:

All players take two skulls from the current space. Remove the rest of the skulls from the tzompantli. No more skulls can be collected from tiles due to flooding. Skulls can only be obtained through battle. Cards and bonuses still apply. 

## Cortez' Invasion:

No skulls can be collected except in battle. Each player battles against Cortez' invasion force every turn throughout the apocalypse by rolling 1D against Cortez. Due to thier superior weaponry, Cortez' army always rolls a 5. Skulls lost to Cortez in battle are removed from play and cannot be sacrificed. Skulls won in battle are picked up from the current tzompantli. Cards and bonuses still apply.
